# Enterprise-ready cloud hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you are working with Trey Research to setup some best practices regarding policies, permissions, and managing their Azure subscriptions using advanced tooling such as Azure Blueprints. Tasks include creating scripts that Enterprise IT will use to automatically set policy and delegate permissions when a new subscription is created. You will also learn how to manage these policies and permissions for multiple subscriptions using Azure Management Groups and Azure Blueprints.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will know how to provide cost tracking by business unit, environment and project, provide for a distributed administration model, put a service catalog in place to prevent deployment of unsupported Azure services, and put controls in place to allow deployment of services only in specific regions.

## Overview

Trey Research is a manufacturing company that builds consumer products with 29.6 billion USD in annual revenue. Trey's headquarters are in New Jersey, but they have data centers and branch offices scattered across the United States; with several major offices in the United Kingdom, France, and Japan.

Even as large as it is, Trey seeks to maximize the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of its IT, especially in new projects and business units. With a dizzying number of existing business units; each with their own unique requirements from IT and ballooning costs from internal hardware and data center investment, Trey is looking to the cloud.

Trey is interested in a large-scale solution that will help mitigate creeping costs and start the transition to a modern cloud-based enterprise architecture using a solid set of controls for governance.

## Requirements

1. Full global admin access to the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription.

## Solution architecture

![Hierarchy showing Azure AD at the root, then a Management Group, then an Azure Subscription, then resource groups, then resources. It is tagged \'Policies and RBAC\'.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image2.png "Azure AD - Management Group - Subscription - Resource Group hierarchy")

## Exercise 1: Create the policy for Enterprise IT

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will first create a Management Group for your Azure subscription(s). You will apply several of the built-in Azure Policy definitions to that Management Group to ensure that users stay within the scope of supported services for Enterprise IT. Finally, you will create a new policy initiative defining a multi-resource naming convention and apply that initiative to the Management Group.

### Task 1: Create a Management Group

In this task, you will create a new Management Group and move a subscription into this Management Group. We'll later assign Azure Policy using the Management Group scope, so that it applies automatically to all subscriptions under that scope.

> **Note**: We'll use our own Management Group, if you have permissions you could also use the Tenant Root Management Group.

1. Launch the Azure portal and navigate to **Management Groups** under **All services**.

    ![Portal screenshot showing All Service \> Management Groups selection sequence.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image4.png "Create Management Group selection path")

2. Select **Start using management groups** to launch the **Add management group** blade.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Start using management groups button that is used to launch the Add management group blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image89.png "Start using management groups button")

    If you already have management groups in place, you can use the **Add management group** button to launch the **Add management group** blade.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Add management group button that is used to launch the Add management group blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image91.png "Add management group button")

3. In the **Add management group** blade enter **ERC** for the Management group ID and **Enterprise Ready Cloud** for the Management group display name. Select **Save**. If you have existing management groups, create this as a child of Root and select **Save**. Note that the Management group ID cannot be updated after creation but your display name can be updated later.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing New Management Group, then the group ID and name being filled in.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image5.png "Create Management Group blade")

    > **Note**: If this is the first management group being created, note that it may take up to 15 minutes for it to complete.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the notification that it may take up to 15 minutes to create the management group.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image90.png "Create management group notification")

4. Select the newly created management group, then select **details**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the details link for the newly created management group.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image92.png "Details link")

5. Select **Add Subscription** and for the subscription, choose your subscription from the drop-down list, then select **Save**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing adding an existing subscription to a management group](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image6.png "Add subscription to management group screenshot")

### Task 2: Apply the service catalog policy

In this exercise, you will apply one of the built-in Azure Policies to restrict services to the supported list provided by Trey Research.

1. First, we need to build a list of resource types, which will be permitted, and their corresponding resource providers. One way to do this is to use PowerShell. Launch the **Azure Cloud Shell** and select PowerShell. If prompted to create storage, select the **Create storage** button. Accept the prompt for storage.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the button to launch the Azure Cloud Shell.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image93.png "Azure Cloud Shell launch button")

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell first launch experience.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image94.png "Azure Cloud Shell PowerShell")

2. Run the following script in the shell:

    ```powershell
    $FormatEnumerationLimit = -1
    Get-AzResourceProvider `
        | Select-Object ProviderNamespace, ResourceTypes `
        | Format-List
    ```

3. Review the list, and identify the resource providers and resource types for each of the following:

    ```s
    Resource Name
    --------------------------
    - Resource Group
    - Virtual Machines
    - Disk
    - Network Interface
    - Public IP Address
    - Network Security Group
    - Virtual Networks
    - Virtual Network Gateways
    - ExpressRoute Circuits
    - VPN Gateways
    - Storage Accounts
    - Backup Vault
    - Site Recovery Vault
    - DevTest Labs
    - Key Vault
    - Web Apps
    - SQL Database
    ```

    For example, to find all the resource providers with resource groups as a resource type, a query like the following could be used:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzResourceProvider `
        | Select-Object ProviderNamespace, ResourceTypes `
        | Where-Object { $_.ResourceTypes.ResourceTypeName -like "*resource*groups*" } `
        | Format-List
    ```

    This query shows that the `resourceGroups` resource type is a member of the resource provider `Microsoft.Resources`.

    By altering the `-like` clause, you can filter to easily find the resource providers for the remaining resource types.

    > **Note**: If you do not see the Microsoft.Compute resource provider it is because you have not yet created any compute resources. You can manually register the provider with the following command:

    ```powershell
    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute
    ```

4. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Policy** under **All services**:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing selection sequence All Services, then Policy.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image7.png "Azure Policy selection path ")

    > **Hint**: Select the star next to the Policy service to pin it to your Portal navigation. You will visit the Policy service throughout the lab.

5. Select **Definitions**, then **+ Policy definition**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing selection sequence Definitions, then add Policy definition.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image101.png "Add Policy definition")

6. In the Policy definition blade, use the following configurations:

    - Definition location: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (ERC) management group, as created in Task 1.
  
    - Name: **Service catalog**
  
    - Description: **Restrict resource types to those permitted by Enterprise IT**.
  
    - Category: **Create new** > **Service catalog**
  
    - Policy rule: ***Replace the default JSON with the following code:***

    ```json
    {
        "policyRule": {
            "if": {
                "not": {
                    "anyOf": [

9. On the ***Service catalog \- Assign policy blade***, specify the following configurations and then select **Assign** to assign your policy definition to your Enterprise Ready Cloud management group:

    - Scope: **Enterprise Ready Cloud**
  
    - Exclusions: **None**
  
    - Policy definition: **Service catalog**
  
    - Assignment name: **Service catalog policy**
  
    - Description: **Restrict resource types to those permitted by Enterprise IT**.
  
    - Policy enforcement: **Enabled**
  
    - Assigned by: **Enterprise IT**

    The assignment form should look like this:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The Allowed resource types policy has been chosen, and 12 resource types selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image162.png "Assign Policy blade")

10. Select **Review + Create**. Then select the **Create** button to complete the configuration.

### Task 3: Restrict the creation of ExpressRoute circuits

In this exercise, you will apply another built-in Azure policy to restrict the creation of ExpressRoute circuits. For this policy, we'll use an exclusion scope for the resource group in which Enterprise IT will create the permitted ExpressRoute circuits.

1. First, we'll create the resource group for the exclusion scope. Select **Resource groups**, then **Add**, and then enter the resource group name **ExpressRouteRG**, select your subscription, and choose a resource group location:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing adding a resource group called \'ExpressRoute-group\'.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image104.png "Create resource group selection path")

2. Once complete, select **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

3. Return to the **Policy** blade in the Azure portal. Select **Assignments**, then **Assign Policy**. Complete the form as follows:

    - Scope: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (The management group created earlier.)
  
    - Exclusions: **The resource group created in Step 1 above, ExpressRouteRG. Select the management group, subscription, and resource group**.
  
    - Policy definition: **Not allowed resource types**
  
    - Assignment name: **Block ExpressRoute circuits**
  
    - Description: **Block creating of ExpressRoute circuits, except in the Enterprise IT dedicated ExpressRoute resource group**
  
    - Policy enforcement: **Enabled**
  
    - Assigned by: **Enterprise IT**

    The assignment form should look like this:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The policy is \'Not allowed resource types\' and the ExpressRouteCircuits resource type has been selected. The policy is assigned at the Management group scope, with the ExpressRouteGroup resource group as an exclusion path.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image163.png "Assign Policy blade")

4. When complete, select **Next** to set the Parameters in the policy assignment.

5. From the drop-down list select the option **expressRouteCircuits**.

6. Select **Review + create**. Your Assign policy screen should look like the below screen shot. Once confirmed select **Create**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The policy is \'Not allowed resource types\' and the ExpressRouteCircuits resource type has been selected. The policy is assigned at the Management group scope, with the ExpressRouteGroup resource group as an exclusion path.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image164.png "Assign Policy blade")

### Task 4: Restrict the creation of resources in regions

In this exercise, you will create a new Azure Policy assignment that restricts the regions in which resources can be created in.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Policy**, then select **Assignments**, then **Assign Policy**. Complete the form as follows:

    - Scope: **Enterprise Ready Cloud**
  
    - Exclusions: **None**
  
    - Policy definition: **Allowed locations**
  
    - Assignment name: **Restrict Azure locations**
  
    - Description: **Restrict Azure resources to the list of Azure regions permitted by Enterprise IT**
  
    - Policy enforcement: **Enabled**
  
    - Assigned by: **Enterprise IT**

    The assignment form should look like this:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The \'Allowed locations\' policy has been selected, with 6 locations selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image165.png "Assign Policy blade")

2. When complete, select **Next** to set the Parameters on the policy assignment.

3. Within the Allowed Locations drop-down menu, select the following options:

    - Allowed locations: **East US, West US, North Europe, West Europe, Japan East, Japan West**

4. When complete, select **Review + Create** to review the Assign Policy for the locations and allowed resources. Your results should look like the below screen shot.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The \'Allowed locations\' policy has been selected, with 6 locations selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image166.png "Assign Policy blade")

5. Select **Create** to complete the assign policy wizard.

### Task 5: Create and apply a naming convention

In this task, we will define a simple naming convention for Azure resources. We shall simply require that virtual machine names end with ***-vm*** and virtual networks end with ***-vnet***. We will implement this naming convention using a custom policy definition and a policy initiative, assigned at the management group scope.

#### Subtask 1: Create a policy definition <!-- omit in toc -->

First, we will create a generic policy definition that restricts resources of a given type to have a given name suffix. The resource type and name suffix will be specified using parameters.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Policy** blade, then select **Definitions** and then **+ Policy definition**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the selection sequence Policy then Definitions then Add Policy Definition.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image106.png "Add policy definition selection path")

2. Complete the Policy definition form as follows:

    - Definition location: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (The Management Group created earlier.)
  
    - Name: **Restrict Resource Name Suffix**
  
    - Description: **Restrict resources of a given type to have a name ending with a given suffix. The resource type and suffix are parameterized.**
  
    - Category:  **Create new** > **Naming**
  
    - Policy rule: **Replace with the below JSON**:

    ```json
    {
        "properties": {
            "mode": "all",
            "parameters": {
                "resourceType": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "metadata": {
                        "displayName": "Resource Type",
                        "description": "The resource type for this policy",
                        "strongType": "resourceTypes"
                    }
                },
                "nameSuffix": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "metadata": {
                        "displayName": "Resource Name Suffix",
                        "description": "The suffix that must be appended"
                    }
                }
            },
            "policyRule": {
                "if": {
                    "allof": [
                    {
                        "field": "type",
                        "equals": "[parameters('resourceType')]"
                    },
                    {
                        "not": {
                        "field": "name",
                        "like": "[concat('*-', parameters('nameSuffix'))]"
                        }
                    }
                    ]
                },
                "then": {
                    "effect": "deny"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Once the policy definition is complete, select **Save**.

#### Subtask 2: Create a policy initiative <!-- omit in toc -->

Next, we shall create a policy initiative comprising multiple instances of our policy definition (one per resource type).

1. From the **Policy** blade, on the **Definitions** panel, select **+ Initiative Definition**.

2. Fill in the **Initiative definition** blade as follows (but **do not** select **Save** yet).

    - Definition location: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (The Management Group created earlier.)
  
    - Name: **Naming Convention**
  
    - Description: **Trey Research resource naming convention**
  
    - Category: **Use Existing** > **Naming**

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the \'Basics\' section of the New Policy Initiative Definition blade. The Name has been filled in as \'Naming Convention\'.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image167.png "New Policy Definition - Basics")

3. Under ***Available Definitions***, find the *Restrict Resource Name Suffix* policy definition created in Step 2.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the \'Available Definitions\' section of the New Policy Initiative Definition blade. The filter has been filled in as \'restrict\' and the results show the \'Restrict Resource Name Suffix\' policy definition](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image14.png "Available Definitions screenshot")

4. Select the policy definition, then select **+Add** to add the Policy Definition to the Policy Initiative.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing adding the \'restrict resource name suffix\' custom policy definition to a policy initiative](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image15.png "Adding Policy Definition to Policy Initiative")

5. Select the resource type and name suffix. In this case, we'll choose **Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines** as the resource type and **vm** as the name suffix. **Do not select Save**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing filling in the parameters for the \'Restrict Resource Name Suffix\' policy definition, as part of the policy initiative definition](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image16.png "Policies and Parameters screenshot")

6. Repeat steps 3-5 above except enter the following values:

      - Resource Type: **Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks**

      - Resource Name Suffix: **vnet**

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing filling in the parameters for the \'Restrict Resource Name Suffix\' policy definition, as part of the policy initiative definition.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image168.png "Policies and Parameters screenshot")

7. Once you've added each resource type, select **Save**.

8. Finally, we will apply the policy initiative across all subscriptions in the Management Group by creating an assignment at the Management group scope. On the **Policy** blade, select **Assignments** and then **Assign Initiative**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the selection sequence Policy then Assignments then Assign Initiative.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image108.png "Assign Initiative selection path")

9.  Complete the Assign Initiative form as follows:

    - Scope: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (The Management Group created earlier.)
  
    - Exclusions: **None**

    - Initiative definition: **Naming Convention** (The initiative definition we just created.)
  
    - Assignment name: **Resource Naming Convention**
  
    - Description: **Enforces company-wide resource naming convention**
  
    - Policy enforcement: **Enabled**
  
    - Assigned by: **Enterprise IT**

    The assignment form should look like this:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Initiative blade. The Naming Convention policy initiative has been selected, and the assignment is at the management group scope.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image169.png "Assign Initiative Azure portal blade")

10. When complete, select **Review + Create**, then select **Create** to create the policy initiative assignment.

### Task 6: Test the policies

In this task, you will use the Azure management portal to validate each of the policies created so far and understand how to identify policy events.

#### Subtask 1: Test the service catalog policy <!-- omit in toc -->

1. In the portal's left navigation select **Create a Resource \> Internet of Things \> IoT Hub**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing selection sequence to create an IoT Hub resource](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image19.png "Create IoT hub Azure portal selection path")

2. Specify a unique name for the IoT Hub by using the **Deployment ID** (provided to you in the lab credentials) as a prefix or suffix (see below screenshot for reference) and choose the existing **ExpressRouteRG** resource group. Choose a permitted location (we are only testing the Service Catalog policy at this time).

    Once all the settings have been filled in, select **Review + create** followed by **Create**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the review and create experience for an IoT Hub.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image95.png "Azure IoT Hub Create")

3. The IoT Hub creation blade should show an error. If you select the error message you will see in the activity log that there were policy errors. 

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing error message](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image21.png "Error screenshot")

#### Subtask 2: Test the ExpressRoute circuit policy <!-- omit in toc -->

1. In the portal's left navigation, select **Create a resource** **\>** **Networking** **\>** **ExpressRoute**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the selection sequence to create an ExpressRoute circuit](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image23.png "Create ExpressRoute selection path")

2. Specify the following configuration for the circuit and select **Create**.

    - Create new or import from classic: **Create new**
  
    - Circuit name: **TestCircuit**
  
    - Provider: **AT&T**
  
    - Peering location: **Silicon Valley**
  
    - Bandwidth: **50Mbps**
  
    - SKU: **Standard**
  
    - Billing model: **Unlimited**
  
    - Subscription: **Select your Azure subscription**.
  
    - Resource group: (Create new) **PolicyTestRG**.
   
    - Location: **Any available location in the allowed locations policy including East US, West US, North Europe, West Europe, Japan East, Japan West**.

    ![The Circuit configuration fields are set to the following settings: Circuit name, TestCircuit; Provider, AT&T; Peering location, Silicon Valley; Bandwidth, 50Mbps; SKU, Standard; Billing model, Unlimited; Subscription, Microsoft Azure; Resource Group, PolicyTestRG, Location, West US.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image24.png "Circuit configuration fields")

3. As with the Service Catalog policy, you should see an error in the Create ExpressRoute Circuit blade, which when selected shows the error details:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing error message \"The template deployment failed because of policy violation\".](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image96.png "Validation Error screenshot")


    > **Note**: If you created a new resource group in the previous step, you will see that the resource group has been created even though the deployment of the resource failed. This is because the policy that was created to restrict the creation of ExpressRoute circuits specifically targets that Azure resource type and a resource group is another distinct resource type.

#### Subtask 3: Test the resource location policy <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Testing the resource location policy follows a similar pattern. You would attempt to create a permitted resource, with a permitted name, but in a non-permitted region. For example, you can attempt to create a virtual network within the **PolicyTestRG** resource group named **erc-vnet** in **South Central US**. This should be rejected by the **Restrict Azure locations** policy.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing Errors blade. The error message states the template deployment failed due to a policy violation.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image110.png "Policy Violation error message")

2. To test further, change the region to a permitted location (e.g. **East US**) and try again. This time, the virtual network should be created without issue.

    > **Note**: Recall that an initiative assignment was made earlier to deny the creation of resources that do not meet the organizational naming conventions. If you had attempted to create a virtual networking without `-vnet` in its name, the creation of the resource would have been denied by the initiative assignment and its associated configuration.

#### Subtask 4: Test the naming convention policy <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Attempt to create a permitted resource, in a permitted location, with a non-permitted name. For example, create a virtual network within the **PolicyTestRG** resource group named **erc-network** in the **East US** region. This should be rejected by the **Resource Naming Convention** policy.

2. To test further, change to a permitted name (e.g. **erc-network-vnet**) and try again---this time, the virtual network should be created without issue.

## Exercise 2: Configure delegated permissions

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure delegated permissions for users in the Trey Research business unit. You will use the Azure AD Graph commands in the Azure CLI to work with users and groups and you will extend a PowerShell script to automatically provision a limited access user with the configuration of the subscription.

### Task 1: Create groups in Azure AD for delegation

In this task, you will create two groups in Azure AD that you will use for testing delegated access control. In the next task, users will be created that will be added to these new security groups.

1. Launch the Azure Cloud Shell and select **PowerShell** if prompted. If prompted to create storage, select the **Create storage** button and make sure to use an allowed region according to the policy you defined earlier.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the button to launch the Azure Cloud Shell.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image93.png "Azure Cloud Shell launch button")

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell first launch experience.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image94.png "Azure Cloud Shell PowerShell")

    > **Note**: In the following commands, we will use the Azure CLI to provision users and groups in Azure AD. The PowerShell Cloud Shell gives us access to *both* the Azure PowerShell module (Az) and the Azure CLI.

2. In the shell, execute the following script to create two new security groups:

    ```s
    az ad group create --display-name "BU-Electronics-Admins" --mail-nickname "BU-Electronics-Admins"
    az ad group create --display-name "BU-Electronics-Users" --mail-nickname "BU-Electronics-Users"
    ```

### Task 2: Create user accounts in Azure AD for delegation

In this task, you will create two user accounts in Azure AD that you will use for testing delegated access control.

1. Execute the following script to find out the name of your Azure AD tenant (this will be needed in the next step) and store it in a variable. Be sure to make note of it in Notepad as well. It will be needed in the next task.

    ```s
    $aadDomain = (az ad signed-in-user show --query userPrincipalName -o tsv).Split("@")[1]
    echo $aadDomain
    ```

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the tenant name in the cloud shell](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/TenantName.png "Azure tenant name")

2. Create the first user, **Electronics Admin** and add the user to the **BU-Electronics-Admins** security group.

    ```s
    az ad user create --display-name "Electronics Admin" --password "demo@pass123" --user-principal-name "ElectronicsAdmin@$aadDomain"
    $memberId = (az ad user show --id "ElectronicsAdmin@$aadDomain" --query objectId -o tsv)
    az ad group member add --group "BU-Electronics-Admins" --member-id $memberId
    ```

3. Next, create the user **Electronics User** and add the user to the **BU-Electronics-Users** security group.

    ```s
    az ad user create --display-name "Electronics User" --password "demo@pass123" --user-principal-name "ElectronicsUser@$aadDomain"
    $memberId = (az ad user show --id "ElectronicsUser@$aadDomain" --query objectId -o tsv)
    az ad group member add --group "BU-Electronics-Users" --member-id $memberId
    ```

### Task 3: Enable a business unit administrator for the subscription

In this task, you will update a script to automatically add a user to the contributor role of the subscription.

1. Create a new script in the Cloud Shell using **code** by running the following:

    ```s
    code
    ```

2. Add the following code to script. This code will retrieve the object ID for the Active Directory group passed in and assign the group to the Contributor role on the subscription.

    ```powershell
    param([string]$SubscriptionId, [string]$AdGroupName)

    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId

    $scope = "/subscriptions/$SubscriptionId"

    $groupObjectId = (Get-AzADGroup -SearchString $AdGroupName).Id

    Write-Output "Adding group to contributor role"

    New-AzRoleAssignment -Scope $scope `
                            -RoleDefinitionName "Contributor" `
                            -ObjectId $groupObjectId
    ```

    This code will add an Azure AD security group to the contributor role at the subscription scope.

3. Save the file as **ConfigureSubscription.ps1** by selecting **Save** in under the ellipsis (...).

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell and the Save function in code.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image111.png "Azure Cloud Shell code Save file command")

4. Close **code** by selecting **Close Editor** under the ellipsis (...).

5. Create a local variable in the **Console** containing your Subscription ID (you can copy your subscription ID from the Azure portal, or obtain it using `Get-AzSubscription`). In this example, we will obtain is using the referenced cmdlet.

    ```powershell
    $SubscriptionId = (Get-AzSubscription).SubscriptionId
    ```

    > **Note**: If your account has access to multiple Azure subscriptions you may need to alter the command to target the proper subscription using the `-SubscriptionId` or `-SubscriptionName` parameter with the `Get-AzSubscription` cmdlet.

6. Execute the script passing in the `-SubscriptionID` and `-AdGroupName` parameters:

    ```powershell
    . $HOME\ConfigureSubscription.ps1 -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId -AdGroupName "BU-Electronics-Admins"
    ```

7. In a different type of browser, or in an InPrivate or Incognito mode window in your current browser navigate to the Azure management portal in a browser at <http://portal.azure.com>, and sign in using the **ElectronicsAdmin** credentials created earlier and shown below. Be sure to include your tenant name in the username. 

    - Username: **electronicsadmin@[the tenant name you noted earlier]**

    - Password: **demo@pass123**

    > **Note**: You may be prompted to configure a method of resetting your account. You may be able to skip this but if not, you can choose either a phone call or email.

8. Select **All services** then search for and select **Subscriptions**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing subscriptions button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image112.png "Subscriptions button")

9.  Select the name of the subscription you have been using.

10. Select the **Access control (IAM)** on the left and select the **Role assignments** tab:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing \'Access Control (IAM)\' button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image34.png "Access Control button")

11. You should see the **BU-Electronics-Admins** group assigned to the contributor role.

    ![Under User, the BU-Electronics-Admin group is circled. It has the Role of Contributor, and Access as Assigned.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image113.png "BU-Electronics-Admin group")

    > **Note**: Users in the Contributor role scoped at the subscription have full access to all the resources within the subscription but cannot grant access to others or change policies on the subscription.

### Task 4: Enable project-based delegation and chargeback with tags

In this task, you will create a script that will create a new resource group, assign 'Owner' rights over the resource group to a given AD group, and then apply a policy to enforce an 'IOCode' and 'CostCenter' tag with a given value.

1. Login to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com> using your normal credentials (not the **ElectronicsAdmin** account).

2. Launch the Azure Cloud Shell and select PowerShell if prompted. If prompted to create storage, select the **Create storage** button.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell first launch experience.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image94.png "Azure Cloud Shell PowerShell")

3. Create a new script called **CreateProjectResourceGroup.ps1** and open it in the Cloud Shell using **code** by entering the following:

    ```s
    touch CreateProjectResourceGroup.ps1; code CreateProjectResourceGroup.ps1
    ```

4. Add the following code to the script, and **Save** the file by selecting **Save** under the ellipse (...):

    ```powershell
    param(
        [string]$SubscriptionId,
        [string]$ResourceGroupName,
        [String]$Location,
        [String]$IOCode,
        [String]$CostCenter,
        [string]$AdGroupName
    )

    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId

    # Create resource group
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name $ResourceGroupName -Location $Location 

    $scope = "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroupName"

    # Assign Owner role to given group
    $groupObjectId = (Get-AzADGroup -SearchString $AdGroupName).Id

    New-AzRoleAssignment -Scope $scope `
                            -RoleDefinitionName "Owner" `
                            -ObjectId $groupObjectId

    # Assign policy to apply IOCode tag
    $definition = Get-AzPolicyDefinition | where {$_.Properties.displayName -eq "Append a tag and its value to resources"}

    $parameters = @{
        tagName = 'IOCode'
        tagValue = $IOCode
        }

    New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name "AppendIOCode" `
                                -Scope $scope `
                                -DisplayName "Append IO Code" `
                                -PolicyDefinition $definition `
                                -PolicyParameterObject $parameters

    # Assign policy to apply CostCenter tag
    $definition = Get-AzPolicyDefinition | where {$_.Properties.displayName -eq "Append a tag and its value to resources"}

    $parameters = @{
        tagName = 'CostCenter'
        tagValue = $CostCenter
        }

    New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name "AppendCostCenter" `
                                -Scope $scope `
                                -DisplayName "Append Cost Center" `
                                -PolicyDefinition $definition `
                                -PolicyParameterObject $parameters
    ```

    This PowerShell script creates a new resource group in the specified region. It then assigns the group to the owner role definition just for the resource group. It will allow users in the group to have full ownership of resources within the resource group only. This code applies a built-in policy to append a tag with the name **IOCode** and another tag for **CostCenter** and then applies the given tag value to any resource created in the resource group.

    > **Note**: The **Apply tag and its default value** policy applies tags to the resources included in the assignment scope, but it does not apply any tags to the parent resource group for those resources. It is important to understand that in Azure, tags are not automatically inherited from a parent object without additional configuration.

5. Close **code** by selecting **Close Editor** under the ellipsis (...).

6. In the **Console** pane, create a new variable called **\$location**, and specify a region name to deploy to the resource group to. This location must be one of the supported regions in your previously created policy.

    ```powershell
    $location = "East US"
    ```

7. In the **Console** pane, create a new variable called **\$resourceGroupName**, and specify the value as **DelegatedProjectDemRG**. Also, make sure you create a **\$SubscriptionId** variable as you did earlier.

    ```powershell
    $resourceGroupName = "DelegatedProjectDemoRG"
    $SubscriptionId = (Get-AzSubscription).SubscriptionId
    ```

    > **Note**: If your account has access to multiple Azure subscriptions you may need to alter the command to target the proper subscription using the `-SubscriptionId` or `-SubscriptionName` parameter with the `Get-AzSubscription` cmdlet.
    >
    > **Note**: If you receive an error similar to the following `Get-AzSubscription : The access token expiry UTC time '4/24/2019 3:31:22 PM' is earlier than current UTC time '4/24/2019 3:44:34 PM'.` you can re-authenticate to your Azure account using the `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet.

8. In the **Console** pane, execute the following command to create a new resource group with delegated permissions and IO Code and Cost Center policies scoped to the resource group.

    ```powershell
    . $HOME\CreateProjectResourceGroup.ps1 -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Location $location -IOCode "1000150" -CostCenter "Marketing" -AdGroupName "BU-Electronics-Admins"
    ```

9. Create a new storage account in the resource group to validate the ioCode tag was applied (replace *uniquestorageaccount* with a unique value using you **Deployment ID** as a suffix or prefix).

    ```powershell
    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
        -Name "uniquestorageaccount" `
        -SkuName Standard_LRS `
        -Location $location
    ```

10. You can now search for resources with the applied tags to verify the policy has been applied. Execute the following PowerShell commands to validate that the storage account has been tagged.

    ```powershell
    Get-AzResource -TagName IOCode
    Get-AzResource -TagName CostCenter
    ```

    In the output, you should see your storage account returned for each tag.

    ![A screen of the output of the command Get-AzResource -TagName CostCenter.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image98.png "PowerShell output")

    > **Note**: It can take several minutes for the policies assignments that were made in the previous step to take effect. If you find that the tags were not automatically applied, delete the storage account and recreate it. After recreating it, you should see the tags applied with the `Get-AzResource` cmdlet.

11. Switch back to the Azure Management portal using the **ElectronicsAdmin** credentials.

    - Username: **electronicsadmin@[the tenant name you noted earlier]**

    - Password: **demo@pass123**

12. Select **Resource Groups**.

13. Select the **DelegatedProjectDemoRG** resource group.

    ![Screenshot of the DelegatedProjectDemo resource group.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image114.png "DelegatedProjectDemo resource group")

14. Select **Access control (IAM)**, then select the **Role assignments** tab. Note that the BU-Electronics-Admins security group is set as an Owner of the resource group.

    ![Under User, the BU-Electronics-Admin group now has the Role of Owner, Contributor, which is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image115.png "Owner, Contributor permissions")

15. Select **+ Add** followed by **Add role assignment**.

    ![Screenshot of the Add role assignments button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image116.png "Add role assignments button")

16. Select **Owner** for the Role.

    ![In the Add permissions blade, Owner is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image41.png "Add permissions role assignment blade")

17. Select the **BU-Electronics-Users** group and select **Save** to add the group to the role.

    ![BU-Electronics-Users is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image42.png "BU-Electronics-Users")

Now both the security groups **BU-Electronics-Admins** and **BU-Electronics-Users** are both Owners of at the **DelegatedProjectDemoRG** scope and members of each security group have full control over the resource group and all its resources.

## Exercise 3: Use Azure Blueprints to govern your Azure environment

Duration: 75 minutes

In this exercise you will create an Azure Blueprint at the Management Group scope to model your Azure environment using Azure Blueprint artifacts such as resource groups, Azure Resource Manager templates, resource locks, Azure Policy, and Azure RBAC.

      - CostCenter: **Enterprise IT**
  
    - Require specified tag on resource groups - Tag Name: **IOCode**
  
    - Require specified tag on resource groups - Tag Name: **CostCenter**

    ![The governance-baseline blueprint Assign blueprint form with the Artifact parameters section highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image133.png "Assign blueprint Artifact parameters")

6. Select **Assign**. You will see a notification that the blueprint assignment is being created.

    ![The governance-baseline blueprint assignment being created toast notification.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image134.png "Creating blueprint assignment")

7. Now that the *Service catalog* policy has been updated, the blueprint assignment will be successful.

    ![The governance-baseline blueprint assignment success toast notification.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image138.png "Blueprint assignment created")

8. Select the **Blueprint assignment succeeded** link in the notification to view the status of the blueprint.

### Task 5: Verify blueprint assignment and resource creation

In this task you will verify that the resource artifacts from the blueprint assignment have been created and that the policies deployed as a part of the assignment are operating as designed.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** followed by the **EnterpriseITRG** resource group.

    ![Selecting the EnterpriseITRG resource group in the Azure portal.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image139.png "Resource group selection")

2. Note that both the *IOCode* and *CostCenter* tags have been applied to the resource group. The application of these tags was done through the Azure Resource Manager template that was an artifact within the blueprint assignment.

    ![The EnterpriseITRG in the Azure portal with the IOCode and CostCenter tags highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image140.png "Resource group tags")

3. Next, select the storage account prefixed with *treyrsrch*.

4. In the **Overview** pane, note the tags for *IOCode* and *CostCenter* have been inherited from the parent resource group. These tags were not a part of the Azure Resource Manager template and are a product of the Azure Policy artifacts in the blueprint.

    ![The treyrsrch storage account in the Azure portal with the IOCode and CostCenter tags highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image141.png "Resource tags")

### Task 6: Editing blueprints

In this task, you will edit the existing blueprint to add an additional policy to audit for the compliance of the resource group tag(s) matching the tags of child resources and publish the updated blueprint to your Azure subscription.

#### Subtask 1: Create a policy definition <!-- omit in toc -->

The policy required to audit for the match of a given tag name and value is a custom policy. To leverage the policy within a blueprint, we first need to create the policy at the same scope as our blueprint, which in this case is the Enterprise Ready Cloud (ERC) management group.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Policy service.

2. Select **Definitions** and then select **+ Policy definition**.

    ![Policy definitions blade in the Azure portal with the Add policy definition button highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image143.png "Add policy definition")

3. In the **New Policy definition** form, enter the following values:

    - Definition location: The **Enterprise Ready Cloud** management group.
  
    - Name: **Audit tag and its value from the resource group**
  
    - Description: **Audit tag and its value from the resource group**

    - Category: **(Create new) Tagging**
  
    - Policy rule: **Use the definition in the following code block**:

    ```json
    {
        "mode": "Indexed",
        "parameters": {
            "tagName": {
                "type": "String",
                "metadata": {
                    "displayName": "Tag Name",
                    "description": "Name of the tag, such as 'environment'"
                }
            }
        },
        "policyRule": {
            "if": {
                "not": {
                    "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
                    "equals": "[resourceGroup().tags[parameters('tagName')]]"
                }
            },
            "then": {
                "effect": "audit"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ![Adding a new policy definition to audit that a given tag on resource group is the same name and value on child resources.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image144.png "New policy definition")

4. Select **Save**.

#### Subtask 2: Create a policy initiative <!-- omit in toc -->

To simplify the management of our blueprint, next we will create a new initiative definition for use in the existing governance-baseline blueprint.

1. Select **Definitions** followed by **+ Initiative definition**.

    ![In the Azure portal, select Definitions followed by Add initiative definition.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image145.png "Add initiative definition")

2. In the **New Initiative definition** form, enter the following values:

    - Definition location: The **Enterprise Ready Cloud** management group.
  
    - Name: **Governance Baseline Initiative**

    - Description: **Governance Baseline Initiative for use in the governance-baseline blueprint**
  
    - Category: **(Use existing) Tagging**

3. Add the following policies to the initiative and set the parameters to the following:

      - **Audit tag and its value from the resource group**
        - Value(s): **Use Initiative Parameter**
          - **TAGNAME_1**
  
      - **Audit tag and its value from the resource group**
        - Value(s): **Use Initiative Parameter**
          - **TAGNAME_2** (select **Create a new initiative parameter**)
  
      - **Require a tag on resource groups**
        - Value(s): **Use Initiative Parameter**
          - **TAGNAME_1**

      - **Require a tag on resource groups**
        - Value(s): **Use Initiative Parameter**
          - **TAGNAME_2**
  
      - **Append tag and its value from the resource group**
        - Value(s): **Use Initiative Parameter**
          - **TAGNAME_1**

      - **Append tag and its value from the resource group**
        - Value(s): **Use Initiative Parameter**
          - **TAGNAME_2**

    The form should look like the following:

    ![Creation of a new initiative definition at the ERC scope.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image146.png "New initiative definition")

4. Select **Save**. This new initiative definition allows us to consolidate all the policy assignments in our existing blueprint to ensure the presence of the *IOCode* and *CostCenter* tags on resource groups and that child resources not only have those tags, but that their values match the parent resource group as well.

#### Subtask 3: Update the blueprint definition <!-- omit in toc -->

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Blueprints service.

2. Select **Blueprint definitions** and then the **governance-baseline** blueprint created in the previous task.

    ![The Blueprint definitions blade in the Azure portal with the governance-baseline blueprint highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image128.png "Blueprint definitions")

3. Select **Edit blueprint**.

    ![The Blueprint definitions blade in the Azure portal with the governance-baseline open and the Edit blueprint button highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image142.png "Edit blueprint")

4. Select **Next : Artifacts >>**.

    ![The blueprint assignments blade in the Azure portal with the Assignment-governance-baseline-2 blueprint assignment highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image155.png "Blueprint assignments")

18. Wait for the deployment to complete. You will see a message of **Assignment succeeded** upon completion.

    ![The blueprint assignment blade in the Azure portal for the governance-baseline blueprint with the Assignment succeeded message highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image156.png "governance-baseline blueprint assignment")

    > **Note**: Notice that because we used the same values for the resource group and storage account prefix parameters, the Azure Resource Manager template artifact in the blueprint assignment was able to reconcile the existing resources not and not create new ones.

### Task 7: Verify compliance with Azure Policy

In this task you will explore the compliance features of Azure Policy by working with the previously created audit policy that was a part of the *Governance Baseline Initiative* initiative definition created in the *Enterprise Ready Cloud* management group.

1. Launch the Azure Cloud Shell and select PowerShell if prompted. If prompted to create storage, select the **Create storage** button.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the button to launch the Azure Cloud Shell.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image93.png "Azure Cloud Shell launch button")

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell first launch experience.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image94.png "Azure Cloud Shell PowerShell")

2. Execute the following script to create a new resource group.

    ```s
    az group create -n MarketingRG -l eastus --tags IOCode=1000150 CostCenter=Marketing
    ```

3. Execute the following script to move the existing storage account in *EnterpriseITRG* to the resource group *MarketingRG*. When prompted, select **Yes** to initiate the move.

    ```powershell
    $resource = Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName EnterpriseITRG | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "treyrsrch*" -and $_.ResourceType -eq "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts" }
    Move-AzResource -DestinationResourceGroupName MarketingRG -ResourceId $resource.ResourceId
    ```

    ![Azure Cloud Shell screenshot showing the move request for a resource from one resource group to another.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image157.png "Azure Cloud Shell PowerShell")

    > **Note**: It will take several minutes for the move to complete. Do not proceed to the next step until the script has completed.

4. Execute the following script to view the tags on the *MarketingRG* resource group and the moved storage account.

    ```powershell
    Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {
        Write-Output "Resource group tags:"
        Write-Output (Get-AzResourceGroup -Name MarketingRG).Tags
        Write-Output "Storage account tags:"
        Write-Output (Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName MarketingRG | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "treyrsrch*" -and $_.ResourceType -eq "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts" }).Tags
    }
    ```

    Do the tags match?

    > **Note**: In this case the tags do not match. The Azure Policy which appends tags from the resource group to child resources only effects create and update operations and not move operations.

5. In addition to Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI, Azure Policy can be used to view the compliance of your resources through both the Azure portal and the command line.

6. Navigate to the Policy service in the Azure portal and select **Compliance** followed by **Governance Baseline Initiative**.

    ![Azure Policy compliance in the Azure Portal with the Governance Baseline Initiative highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image158.png "Azure policy compliance")

7. On the **Initiative compliance** blade, select one of the **Audit tag and its value from the resource group** policies.

    ![A screenshot of the Initiative compliance blade in the Azure Portal for the Governance Baseline Initiative with one of the Audit tag and its value from the resource group policies highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image159.png "Initiative compliance")

8. On the **Policy compliance** blade, you can view all the non-compliant resources.

    ![A screenshot of the Policy compliance blade in the Azure Portal for the Governance Baseline Initiative with one of the Audit tag and its value from the resource group policies highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image160.png "Policy compliance")

    > **Note**: This is an audit policy, not a deny policy, so it does not prevent the creation of resources, but it can surface resource that do not meet your organizational standards and offer a clear line of sight to remediation.

9. You may (or may not) see the non-compliant state of the storage account that was moved earlier. Azure policy compliance checks do not currently have a published SLA for how long it takes an initial compliance check to occur or how long it takes for ongoing compliance checks to occur.

    It is often on the order of the less than 20-30 minutes for evaluation and when the next check occurs the storage account that was moved earlier will be flagged as non-compliant, because while the tag names for the child resources in the *MarketingRG* for *CostCenter* and *IOCode* are present, their values on the storage account do not match the parent the values of the tags on the parent resource group.

    ![A screenshot of the Resource compliance blade in the Azure Portal for the Governance Baseline Initiative and the Audit tag and its value from the resource group policy.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image160.png "Resource compliance")

## Exercise 4: Monitoring Compliance and Cost

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise you will create an Azure Virtual Machine to use as a resource to monitor the compliance based on settings you will set. You will experience the Change History activity gaining visibility on when, who, how and if the resource was successful changed. You will create a Policy that will prevent further changes of the SKU for Virtual Machine. You will then review the Compliance details will of the policy allowing you to gain insight on operations against the resource on compliant and non-compliant resources. Last you will create a budget setting alerts to ensure that cost remain within the boundaries you have set.
